Architecture Diagram Explanation: AWS Microservices-Based Payment Processing System

1. Key Design Decisions and Trade-Offs

Microservices on ECS with Fargate: We use AWS ECS with Fargate to run stateless microservices, avoiding EC2 maintenance while gaining autoscaling benefits. This decision trades fine-grained infrastructure control for lower operational overhead.

API Gateway + Lambda for Edge Processing: For minimal latency, especially in global regions, we use API Gateway and Lambda at edge locations to validate and route incoming requests.

Aurora Multi-AZ & Global Database: Aurora PostgreSQL offers high availability and cross-region replication. This ensures low RPO and RTO, but at a higher cost than RDS.

S3 + KMS for Secure Storage: Transaction logs and documents are stored in S3 with encryption via KMS. This ensures durability and compliance.

SQS for Decoupling: Queue-based processing ensures resilience and scalability of transaction pipelines.

2. Scaling Strategy

Auto Scaling Groups: ECS services are configured to scale out based on CPU/Memory/Queue depth.

Aurora Read Replicas: Auroraâ€™s read replicas help scale read-heavy workloads without impacting write latency.

API Gateway Throttling & Caching: Protects backend by rate limiting and caching frequent requests.

CloudFront CDN: Used for static content acceleration and API Gateway integration where applicable.

3. Disaster Recovery Approach

Multi-Region Deployment: The system is deployed in two regions using Route 53 latency-based routing with health checks.

Aurora Global Database: Enables near real-time replication and quick failover.

S3 Cross-Region Replication: Ensures logs and receipts are available in backup regions.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform/CloudFormation templates ensure environments can be rebuilt quickly.

4. Security Best Practices

IAM Roles and Least Privilege: Each service uses tightly scoped IAM roles.

VPC Isolation: Services run in private subnets. Public access is restricted via NAT Gateway and ALBs.

WAF and Shield Advanced: Protection against DDoS and common web exploits.

Secrets Manager: Used to manage database/API credentials securely.

Encryption: All data in transit uses TLS 1.2+. At rest, data is encrypted via KMS.

5. Cost Optimization Considerations

Fargate Spot for Non-Critical Jobs: Background processing jobs leverage Spot capacity.

Aurora Auto Scaling & Pause: Non-prod Aurora instances use auto-scaling and can pause during inactivity.

S3 Lifecycle Policies: Logs are tiered to Glacier after 30 days.

CloudWatch Alarms: Monitor and alert on usage anomalies to prevent overspending.

Savings Plans for Lambda/ECS: Commit to usage for lower long-term costs.
